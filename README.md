# Agentic AI Framework

Welcome to the Agentic AI Framework! This notebook introduces you to the Crew AI framework and provides step-by-step instructions to get started.

## Overview

The Crew AI framework is designed to help you build intelligent agents that can perform a variety of tasks. This framework provides tools and libraries to streamline the development process.

This is a proof-of-concept demo notebook. The end goal is to create a short podcast recording given a certain topic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vibinibiv/agentic-ai
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd agentic-ai
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `crewai_demo.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the framework.

### Future Works

For a production grade application, agents and tasks will be defined in scripts and the crew will be assembled when main.py is called.
